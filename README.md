To use Schoolifi, you need to have [Git](^5^) installed on your computer. You can clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file.

## Usage

To create your own courses and content, you need to edit the files in the `docs` folder. You can use any text editor or markdown editor to write your content. The files are organized as follows:

- `index.md`: This is the homepage of your website. You can edit the title, subtitle, and introduction of your website here.
- `about.md`: This is the about page of your website. You can edit the information about yourself, your background, and your goals here.
- `courses`: This is the folder where you store your course content. Each subfolder represents a course, and each file represents a lesson. You can create as many courses and lessons as you want. You can also add images, videos, and other resources to your lessons. To link to a lesson, use the relative path of the file, such as `[Lesson 1](courses/course-1/lesson-1.md)`.
- `config.yml`: This is the configuration file of your website. You can edit the site title, description, theme, logo, favicon, and other settings here.
- `style.css`: This is the custom stylesheet of your website. You can edit the colors, fonts, and other styles here.

To preview your website locally, you can use a tool like [docsify](^6^), which is a simple and lightweight documentation generator. You can install it using [npm](^7^), which is a package manager for JavaScript.

```bash
# Install docsify globally
npm i docsify-cli -g

# Serve the docs folder
docsify serve docs
```

You can then access your website at `http://localhost:3000`.

To deploy your website to GitHub Pages, you need to push your changes to the `master` branch of your repository. You also need to enable GitHub Pages in the settings of your repository, and select the `docs` folder as the source. You can then access your website at `https://your-username.github.io/schoolifi`.
